# YUAA Ornithopter Project

An ornithopter is a flying machine which generates thrust and lift by imitating the flight of birds. Ornithopters have the advantages of maneuverability, versatility, and stealth over traditional aircraft, making them useful in aerial reconnaissance, search and rescue, and agricultural surveying. In this project, we will design and build an ornithopter capable of sustained flight and maneuvering.
